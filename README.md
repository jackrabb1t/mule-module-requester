WELCOME
=======
The goal of this module to enable the request of a resource at any point in a flow. This resource can be a file, a message (from VM, JMS, AMQP, etc.), an e-mail, etc. It's intended for resources that originally can only requested by message sources.

Some of its common use cases are:

- Load a file in the middle of a flow for processing.
- Consume messages (one, N, all) from a queue in the middle of a flow.
- Pull messages from a mail server on demand, to use its data in an enricher for example.

Usage
-----

### Single resource

```xml
<mulerequester:request config-ref="" resource="" timeout="" returnClass="" throwExceptionOnTimeout="" />
```

Request a resource from an address or endpoint. 
To make the request using the address, use the format "protocol://address". E.g.: "file://path/to/file". 
Otherwise, you can use a global endpoint name. E.g.: "fileEndpoint". 

Parameters:
- resource The address of the resource or the global endpoint name
- timeout The timeout to wait for when requesting the resource (optional - default 1000 ms)
- returnClass The return class to which this processor will transform the payload from the requested resource (optional)
- throwExceptionOnTimeout Whether to throw an exception or not if no message is received in the configured timeout (optional - default false)

Returns:
- A MuleMessage containing the requested resource as the payload

### Collection of resources

```xml
<mulerequester:request-collection config-ref="" resource="" timeout="" returnClass="" throwExceptionOnTimeout="" count="" />
```

Request a collection of resources from an address or endpoint. 
To make the request using the address, use the format "protocol://address". E.g.: "file://path/to/file". 
Otherwise, you can use a global endpoint name. E.g.: "fileEndpoint". 

Parameters:
- resource The address of the resource or the global endpoint name
- timeout The timeout to wait for when requesting the resource (optional - default 1000 ms)
- returnClass The return class to which this processor will transform the payload from the requested resource (optional)
- throwExceptionOnTimeout Whether to throw an exception or not if no message is received in the configured timeout (optional - default false)
- count Number of resources to retrieve. Default is -1 (all resources available).

Returns:
- A MuleMessageCollection with the requested resources as part of MuleMessages
